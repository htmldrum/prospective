prospective
===========
10,000 foot: Automation of the process of submitting bottlings for consideration by WineSpectator. Essentially a web portal with user accounts that tracks the statuses of prospctuses.

Technology:
  - Rails 4
    - Devise
    - APIPie
    - CanCan
    - annotate_models
    - FactoryGirl / Capybara ( whatever the testing framework was in the rails tutorial - just copy its user system )
    ? Email

Approval workflow:
  1) Importer/Winemaker submits form request
  2) ATC receives, assigns to Taster
  3) Taster approves, denies bottlings, assigns back to Importer/Winemaker
  4) Importer/Winemaker sends bottlings
  5) ATC receives bottlings, enters them into inventory

App Workflow:
  1) Users signs up for account
  2) User logs in
  <> User is internal
      1) User reviews newly submitted prospectuses
      2) User actions outstanding prospectuses
      <> User is ATC
      <> User is Taster
      <> User is Admin
  <> User is external
    1) CRUD their own prospectuses
    2) May assign back to us

Prospectus status:
  1) New
  2) Submitted
  3) In Review ( assigned to whom? )
    4) Bottles requested
    5) Bottles received
  6) Finalized

Prospectus actions ( client ):
  - Submit application
  - Mail in approved bottles

Prospectus actions( admin ):
  - Review new prosposals:
    1) Assign to taster
    2) Approve selected bottlings
  - Approve selected bottlings
  - Receive bottles sent
  - Chase up bottles that have not been received

Features:
  - Audit trail of assignments / updates
  - Ability to 're-submit' an application
  - Search
    - statuses
    - all prospectuses for a external user
    - all wines in all prospectuses
    - wine makers
  - De-couple from WineDB. Too hard.
  - "Notifications"

Models
======

- User
- Group
- Rights ( cancan )
- Prospectus_revision ( would be nice to model the prospectuses through time )
- Bottling
